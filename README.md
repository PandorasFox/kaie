## A collection of tools around NTWEWY enemy data.

Currently just the main Noise Report (enemy number: days available, drop #s and %xs) as a pretty-printed json blob, and a collection of scripts to render it to markdown.

These scripts are mostly one-offs and are not stellar code. I am releasing them into the public domain as they are fairly trivial. Do what you want!

### TODO:

* Map [internal pin ID => displayed pin#, pin name, and filename for pin art]
  * Possibly rename the pin art to match displayed pin #
* similar for food, noise info, threads, etc
* Make it possible to parse and rerun the scripts used with data from other localizations (for other wikis/etc)
